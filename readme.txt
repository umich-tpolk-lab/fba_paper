Functions/scripts for FA-CX correlation correction

pregress1.m corrects for correlations across subjects;
pregress2.m then corrects for correlations across voxels.

The "looper" scripts loop through all subjects to perform the corrections.
Be sure to input the folders where the FA, CX, and output files are stored.
